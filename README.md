## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nedinator/rbbt.git
   cd rbbt
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
    Make sure you have Go installed. Then, run:
    ```bash
    go mod tidy
    ```

3. **Configure MongoDB:**
    Update the mongoURI variable in mongo.go with your MongoDB connection string.


4. **Run the Application:**

    ```bash

    ```
5. **Sending test GET/POST requests**
*I recommend the POSTMAN extension on VSCode to do this*

**POST**
1. Set method to POST
2. URL - ` http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/v1/new-url`
3. `{"long_url": "https://example.com"}`

**GET**

1. Set method to GET
2. Set URL to `http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/v1/:id` with ':id' being the short_url of a corresponding document in your MongoDB
